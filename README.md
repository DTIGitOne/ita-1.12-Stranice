Second project: This was my first project that I worked on for a couple of hours at a time, and it took me two days to complete. As a beginner, I would be lying if I said it wasn't difficult for me.

As I was making the site, I was so concerned about making it look like the real site that I went into the original coding for the Facebook site to see what fonts and colors they used for their page. But, because of that, I was able to learn a lot of new techniques. It was still messy and you could tell that I was a beginner when I coded it, but all I cared about was that it looked like the original Facebook page and I did.

After finishing this site, I realized I might be able to make a career out of coding and enjoy it.
